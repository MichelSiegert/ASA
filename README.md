    # Advanced Software Engineering
This class is my repository for Advanced Software Engineering. This is probably the one of the easier classes this semester to understand for me. My notes may not be so detailed. This is a class from the university of applied Sciences Kiel. 

## Structure
I write one Scientific paper over like 20 Pages. Probably going to use the double Column style.
